<h1>Tiffany Brown</h1>
    <p>I am a former pharmacy technician turned full-stack web developer. I hope to broaden my reach and experience by traveling the world one day. 
        I am of Caribbean decent and am heavily influenced by my Jamaican food and culture. 
        Born and raised in Brooklyn, NY I am constantly meeting new and interesting people. 
        As a pharmacy technician I have had many customer service opportunities, through which I am able to interact with many New Yorkers. 
        I am dedicated, outgoing, and a team player.</p>
        
    <p>Growing up in a caribbean household, food is at the epicenter, 
        and my father loves to cook and I suppose it rubbed off on me. 
        I love eating different cuisines and making them at home as well. 
        But my first love is baking, recently I was told I have a wheat allergy so my main 
        focus has been to find wheat/gluten free pastry or cake recipes to try that also taste great.</p>
