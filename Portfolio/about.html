<h1>Tiffany Brown</h1>
    <h2>Pharmacy Technician</h2>
    <p>I am a pharmacy technician by day and hope to broaden my horizons by traveling the world one day. 
        I am a 32 year old Caribbean American woman who is heavily influenced by her Jamaican food and culture. 
        Born and raised in Brooklyn, NY I am constantly meeting new and interesting people, all the while finding ways to get out of my comfort zone. 
        I am a pharmacy technician and have always had a variety of customer service opportunities, through which I am able to interact with many New Yorkers. 
        I am dedicated, outgoing, and a team player.</p>
        
    <p>Growing up in a caribbean household, food is at the epicenter of our culture, 
        and my father loves to cook and I guess it rubbed off on me. 
        I love eating  different cuisines and making them at home as well. 
        But my first love I have to say is baking, recently I was told I have a wheat allergy so my main 
        focus has been to find wheat/gluten free pastry or cake recipes to try that also taste great.</p>
